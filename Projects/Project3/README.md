## Advice & Resources

When writing scripts, there are two ways to go about making sure you're on the right track.  When first learning, I recommend running each command on the command line, then writing it in your script if it worked.  If you've programmed before, you may remember that print statements are your best friend when it comes to debugging.

Remember that Google is your friend - its pretty rare as a sys admin to run in to a problem that no one else has ever found.  Between forums, blogs, and **documentation** you can usually find an answer or a place to start.  If you feel like you are going down a "rabbit hole" ask questions on the Discord channel so I or your classmates can push you back in the right direction.


### You've got the magic in you

A very common task as a sys admin is dealing with data.  Specifically, data that needs cleaning up in some fashion.

- In the main folder of your repository, create a folder called `file-scripts`

### Nothing but improvements

Create an improvement to your `my-way` script.  Only create `~/.vim/colors` if the folder does not exist

## System Lockdown

Create a user (fileshare?) who no one can ssh as, but can request downloads from (no shell)
