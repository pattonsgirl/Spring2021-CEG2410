# Project 6

## Advice & Resources

Remember that Google is your friend - its pretty rare as a sys admin to run in to a problem that no one else has ever found.  Between forums, blogs, and **documentation** you can usually find an answer or a place to start.  If you feel like you are going down a "rabbit hole" ask questions on the Discord channel so I or your classmates can push you back in the right direction.

## Project Deliverable

- Create a folder called `Windows` in your repository for the course.  Project documentation should be in a file named `ad-setup.md`
- You may enjoy using MobaXTerm for the RDP connections to the Windows servers.  It can help with password management.

Simulating hardware:

Add volume to AWS instance, mount it?

Install Powershell module for VS Code - may prompt to install additional packages.  Select Yes where prompted
  - Powershell ISE is being phased out

Powershell script that outputs a file to the Desktop.  Use the registry editor to have this script run once at next reboot
